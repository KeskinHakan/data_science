# Basic Explanation of the Data Science

## What is the Data Science?

In this short blog post, I will try to explain the Data Science from my perspective.

Data science is the prediction of the any valuable or meaningful dataset. What does it mean? What can we get when we predict the data with the Data Science? Surely, all of us asking like these questions when we hear the Data Science on the internet or professional work platforms. 

Data science is the statistical and mathematical identifiation of the data' future. The yearly or decade weather dataset can help to predict the next years approximate air temperature. Also, global warming affect can be added the this prediction and to produce the future air temperature for the model. The other example can be prediction about the house price in the Turkey, US or Europe. Datas can use helping with the current and old values to predict the some valuable things in the future.

You do not have to be super clever person to do this. But you have to know statistical, mathematical things and you should have a foresight to explore new things with the data.

I am also Data Analysis/Science enthusiat and this topic always make me exciting to produce new thing. Because, everything is data in the world.

Thanks.
